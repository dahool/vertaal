Migration notes from 1.4 to 1.6

* urls where already using future tags. Just removed pre load of tags in settings
* Removed verify_exists URLFields in models
* Change django.conf.urls.defaults to django.conf.urls
* Use old session serializer to keep support with authopenid 
  SESSION_SERIALIZER = 'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer'
* AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE was deprecated. Using AUTH_USER_MODEL doesn't work the trouble.
  obj.get_profile() was change to use related manager. obj.profile.get()
